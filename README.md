# MemoryTrainer
A tool running on .NET Core 3.1 with WPF extension and requires a Windows operation system. Future release of .NET Core may change this.

# About

The goal of this project is training your memory with small games. I had this idea in my head for a long time after I read some books about Memory training. One popular execercise is recalling a deck of cards using i.e. the PAO method. PAO stands for Person Action Object and the internet is full of resources about this topic. There are some other ideas of games to come, but this is a spare time project and it is done when it is done.
However, the PAO card game is stable now and is ready to use. I am planning a feature for storing the result and save it somewhere. 
Enjoy the tool and hopefully you find it useful.
